# Tonka
CLI program written in zig to calculate how many reps need to be done given a game. Gawd i need to explain that better. Was originally written in C.

Warning this is my first zig program so probably garbage code.

## The goal
Exercise a little more.

## To Do
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Progress Inidicators, spinners or progress bars.
- [ ] GUI with raygui?
